# Bayesian Population Analysis with JAGS

# This is the BPA code "translated" into JAGS. In many cases there are no differences at all compared to the BUGS code, but sometimes  small changes either in the model code or in the function to provide initial values were necessary. When such changes occur, they are most often commented in the code.
